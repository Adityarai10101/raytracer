dependencies are for the weak

update jan 4th

forgive me lord for i have failed to build this without dependencies. still relying on the std lib for file reads and writes. don't necessarily need rand (just use it to make it faster) cuz i can read from /dev/urandom using std lib. but still relyign on std lib.
